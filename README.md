# Korean_Juke_Game_v2

## About

Project idea based on orginal [Dzemoro/Korean_Juke_game](https://github.com/Dzemoro/Korean_Juke_Game). Main difference from the orginal is use of Godot 4.3 instead of pygame. Rest of the textures/sprites were reused. This was made as a learning project of Godot Engine with already fleshed out idea of easy platformer game.
